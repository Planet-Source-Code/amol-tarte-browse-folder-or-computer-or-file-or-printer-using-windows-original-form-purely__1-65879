Hello Friends!
Ever wanted to use the Windows original form for selecting printer / computer / folder or file? No need to create your own form. No need of any control such as drive list box, Folder List Box etc. This one is for you. Try it, purely API based.
Vote if you think that it may be useful for you at some stage!
Thanks!
